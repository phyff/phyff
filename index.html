          <h1> LEARN MORE </h1>
          <p> We are working to make film festivals and filmmaking in general more accessible to high school students. </p>
          <p> PHYFF is a student-run event dedicated to helping teenage creatives find their voice in a rapidly expanding community of young filmmakers. This festival is a great opportunity to show off work and get critiques, as well as to network with peers from the area and make connections. </p>
          <p> The Festival is open to high school students in the greater Philadelphia area and beyond, with free participation for all students, and includes an awards ceremony for the winning films. </p>
