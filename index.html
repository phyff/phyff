        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>The Philadelphia Youth Film Festival (PHYFF) was founded in 2017 by the Upper School Film Club at Germantown Friends School. We are working to make film festivals and filmmaking in general more accessible to high school students.</p>
        <p>PHYFF is a student-run event dedicated to helping teenage creatives find their voice in a rapidly expanding community of young filmmakers. This festival is a great opportunity to show off work and get critiques, as well as to network with peers from the area and make connections.</p>
        <p>The Festival is open to high school students in the greater Philadelphia area and beyond, with free participation for all students, and includes an awards ceremony for the winning films.</p>
