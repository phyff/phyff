      <h1> ABOUT PHYFF </h1>
      <div class="about-phyff">
        <p> PHYFF is a student-run event dedicated to helping teenage creatives find their voice in a rapidly expanding
          community of young filmmakers. We seek to create an environment where our peers could have their work
          recognized without massive budgets or extensive training. We have received submissions from Philadelphia
          schools and ones across the world.</p>
        <p> This festival is a great opportunity to show off work and get critiques, as well as to network with peers
          from the area and make connections. Filmmaking experts will judge and rank submitted films in four categories:
          narrative, documentary, experimental, and screenplay. At each festival, we offer several workshops on a
          variety of common and niche filmmaking focuses.</p>
        <p>The Festival is open to high school students in the greater Philadelphia area and beyond with free
          participation for all students, and it includes an awards ceremony for the winning films. </p>
