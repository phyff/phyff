      <h1> ABOUT PHYFF </h1>
      <div class="about-phyff">
        <p> PHYFF is a student-run event dedicated to helping teenage creatives find their voice in a rapidly expanding
          community of young filmmakers. We seek to create an environment where our peers could have their work
          recognized without massive budgets or extensive training. We have received submissions from Philadelphia
          schools and ones across the world.</p>
        <p> This festival is a great opportunity to show off work and get critiques, as well as to network with peers
          from the area and make connections. Filmmaking experts will judge and rank submitted films in four categories:
          narrative, documentary, experimental, and screenplay. At each festival, we offer several workshops on a
          variety of common and niche filmmaking focuses.</p>
        <p>The Festival is open to high school students in the greater Philadelphia area and beyond with free
          participation for all students, and it includes an awards ceremony for the winning films. </p>

      <!-- <h1> WORKSHOPS </h1> -->
      <!-- <ul class="workshop-list" id="workshop-list">
        <li>
          <h3>Kathy Van Cleve: Screenwriting 101 </h3>
          <p>A quick but fun summary of the fundamentals of all good movie scripts, meaning you'll look at existing
            scripts like Eighth Grade and Get Out, learn about terms like "three act structure" and "the hero's
            journey" and how they apply to writing for film, and figure out why, just maybe, it is harder than you
            thought to write a good script! We'll conduct one fun but short writing assignment during the workshop and
            talk about the "business" of film in the time that avails.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Frauke Levin: Documentary Production: Getting Your Idea Off the Page and In Front of
            the Camera </h3>
          <p>Have you ever had a great idea for a documentary but didn’t know how to make it happen? How do you move
            from idea to getting your characters and shots? We will be looking at examples of projects the filmmaker
            has worked on, spanning such varied topics as Viking Swords and North Korea to deconstruct the early
            production process that led us here.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Jacob Mazer: Scene Analysis 101 </h3>
          <p>Most artists (including filmmakers) are eternal students, studying the work of the greats in order to
            improve their own craft. This workshop will be a primer to watching film with a critical eye. Together,
            we'll discuss a few practical approaches to film analysis, then view a selection of scenes in order to
            figure out how they work and understand their visual storytelling techniques.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Gage Johnston: Style and Substance: How the documentary approach informs the story
          </h3>
          <p>In this seminar, we will look at the six types of documentary: essay, participatory, reflexive,
            performative, poetic and the fly-on-the-wall. What are the strengths of each type? We will have a
            particular focus on the fly-on-the-wall with a discussion of whether or not it possible to achieve
            ‘realism’ and ‘invisibility’ in filmmaking. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Paul Bastin: Essentials of Post-Production Work Flow </h3>
          <p>In creating video and audio content to tell a story, whether it be a commercial, a short or long film,
            social media, etc etc, there are so many details to pay attention to throughout the entire process. After
            all the hard work of in the creative process of developing the story and the actual production of shooting
            the footage, now comes the process of post production, involving the management of the footage, the
            editing, effects, audio mixing, color correction, and final outputs. While there is no way to go into every
            detail of this process, this workshop is intended to go over the broad strokes of what you want to pay
            attention to and have a basic understanding of the importance of each step that allows for a smooth work
            flow, and most importantly a final delivery that is what you wanted, and on time.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Alison Bagnall Standefer: Making a Better Shot </h3>
          <p>Simple tips and tricks for improving your shots! We will touch on lens choice, multiple planes, quickie
            lighting tips, achieving better eye-lines, the 180° rule, and shooting for comedy vs. drama. Bring a camera
            with a zoom lens if you have one or just bring your phone!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Alex Favin: How to be a Student Entrepreneur in the Film Industry </h3>
          <p>This workshop will teach you how to jump-start your career. Explore and discover what inspires you. Learn
            how to balance educational & professional goals on your path to becoming an entrepreneur. Develop an
            understanding of the industry landscape and how to secure the position you want (or create it for
            yourself).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Emory Van Cleve: Lighting Tips for Student Filmmakers </h3>
          <p>Working with limited resources can make lighting a challenge for the student filmmaker. This workshop will
            introduce the key elements of lighting for digital video, some practical tips for working with available
            light, and a few ways to make creative light sources from a trip to the hardware store.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Andre Lee: Why Can't I Use that Song in My Film? </h3>
          <p>Every filmmaker edits their film with music they love. What happens when that music is too expensive
            and/or unavailable for the said film? Copyright laws are complicated. Getting rights to use music in your
            movie can be even more complicated. This workshop will address and answer questions about when you can and
            cannot use a song or piece of music in your film.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Jacqueline Joseph: Character Development </h3>
          <p>You can’t have a film without characters! How do you define and develop your characters in a documentary
            film? What makes characters compelling and allows the audience to engage with the story and your film?
            Through interactive exercises, clips and discussion, we will explore together ways to shape the characters
            in a film.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Glenn Holsten: Compelling Documentary </h3>
          <p>Creating an emotional documentary requires technical skills, for sure, but filmmakers must first consider
            the humans that they are working with and whose stories they are telling. Why would someone want to be the
            subject of a film in the first place? What do they get out of the arrangement? How do you maintain a
            relationship based on care and respect throughout the very long process of filmmaking? What role do the
            subjects have in the storytelling? When crafting stories of struggle and hope, how do you respect the
            subject, and create the critical sense of trust between subject and director that is essential for any
            story to be a success? Documentary filmmaker Glenn Holsten will share clips of from his short and long-form
            works that explore different corners of these questions. </p>
